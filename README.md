# Barcode-Scanner
PWA created using ionic react 

## Concept

Spot Checker gives consumers the ability to scan any given item with a UPC identification barcode and gives direct access to price comparisons across multiple platforms. 

## User Story

Customer is shopping in the tech department and wants to locate product details, check for lower prices, and possibly purchase an item at their convenience if the item is limited. Spot Checker will allow the user to save the results of that scan and the information can be retrieved at the users convenience.
